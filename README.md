### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

##### Sean M. Shiverick


#### Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This project is based on the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set' at the UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#### Project Summary

The first script, run_analysis.R, contains the code for carrying out the instructions for the course project:

1. Merge the training and test data sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set (from data set in step 4) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Code Book

The second script, CodeBook.md, describes the variables, the data, and transformations that were performed to clean up the data set. The README.md file explains how the scripts work and how they are connected. These three scripts are all related to the UCI_HAR_Dataset. 


#### Evaluation Criteria

The project will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project guidelines. Required submissions: 

1) A tidy data set, as described above. 
2) A link to Github repository with your script for performing the analysis. 
3) A code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
